# 💼 Employee Salary Predictor

This is a machine learning-based web application that predicts an employee's salary using their resume details like experience, education level, role, and skills. It also recommends missing skills and visualizes salary trends for the selected role.

## 📌 Project Summary

This project helps users understand what salary they might expect based on their background. After uploading a resume and selecting relevant information, the system predicts salary using a trained machine learning model. It also shows which key skills are missing and displays a graph of future salary trends.
